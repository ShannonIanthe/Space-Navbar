# Space-Hamburger Menu: Day002 of 100 JS Projects in 100 days
Navbar created with HTML, CSS, AND JS

<H3>HIGHS:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I really enjoyed styling this webpage </li>
  <li>Seeing what colors complement each other and complement the photo </li>
  <li>Deciding what font to use for this space theme </li>
</ul>
  
  <h3>LOWS:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>I had complications with the navbar</li>
  <li>I think the hamburger menu is not showing up because it is behind the <br>
  background color or it is behind the background photo</li>
</ul>

<h3> How I resolved the problem </h3>
  <ul>
      <li>I placed a border box around the hamburger menu</li>
  <li>I did not fix the hamburger menu per se but it does look better than before</li>
</ul>
